## Run locally

To run the server locally, you probably need to
   * `npm install`
   * `bower install`
   * install the grunt-cli package
   * run `grunt` from this folder

## Before pushing to production

Get yourself an client ID and Secret from the [Nest developer website](https://developer.nest.com/clients) and put them in server.js

## Pushing to production

I've pushed this to Heroku as is.
